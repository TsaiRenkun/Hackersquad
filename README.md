# HACKER SQUAD

## Persona
Someone that likes to go for hackatons. Sometimes because the registeration is on site, people get left over when there is an imbalance of people that turned up for each role. For example, when there is too many UX/UI people present at the event and there isnt anymore Developers avaliable so they canâ€™t participate in the hackaton.

## Problem Statement
Applicants for Hackathons sometimes are unable to find a team to join due to types of participants being disproportional.
